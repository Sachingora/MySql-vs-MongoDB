# Comparative Analysis of MySQL and MongoDB for Stock Price Prediction & Sentiment Analysis

**Overview:**

This project explores the comparative performance of MySQL (SQL) and MongoDB (NoSQL) in big data storage, sentiment analysis, and stock price forecasting. It evaluates how market sentiment from tweets impacts stock trends and employs advanced forecasting models (ARIMA & LSTM) to predict future stock prices.

**Technical Stack:**

ðŸ”¹ Databases: MySQL (structured data), MongoDB (unstructured data)

ðŸ”¹ Programming Language: Python

ðŸ”¹ Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Plotly Dash

ðŸ”¹ Processing Framework: Apache Spark

ðŸ”¹ NLP Techniques: TextBlob, VADER for sentiment analysis

ðŸ”¹ Forecasting Models: ARIMA (time-series), LSTM (deep learning)

**Key Features:**

âœ… Big Data Storage & Processing: SQL vs NoSQL comparative study for efficiency, scalability, and performance

âœ… Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes Twitter data to classify stock-related sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)

âœ… Stock Price Forecasting: Implements ARIMA for short-term and LSTM for long-term predictions

âœ… Interactive Dashboard: Visualizes market sentiment trends and stock price forecasts dynamically

âœ… Performance Benchmarking: Analyzes query speed, ingestion time, and model accuracy

**Findings & Insights:**

ðŸ“Œ MySQL excels in structured data processing and relational queries, making it ideal for financial datasets.

ðŸ“Œ MongoDB outperforms in scalability and high-speed data ingestion, making it better for handling unstructured social media data.

ðŸ“Œ Sentiment trends correlate with stock movements, validating the impact of public perception on financial markets.

ðŸ“Œ LSTM surpasses ARIMA in capturing non-linear patterns, making it more effective for long-term stock predictions.
